# School Night Funkin': The School Mod
Psych Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

## Mod Support
* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!
* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu. 


## Atleast one change to every week:
### Week 1:
  * 5 New People
  * Epik New Background
### Week 2:
  * Both BF and Skid & Pump does "Hey!" animations
  * Thunders does a quick light flash and zooms the camera in slightly
  * Added a quick transition/cutscene to Monster
### Week 3:
  * BF does "Hey!" during Philly Nice
  * Blammed has a cool new colors flash during that sick part of the song

## Story mode menu rework:

* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.
